# Slowdon: E-Ink Mastodon Frontend

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is an open-source project dedicated to providing an **e-ink friendly frontend for Mastodon**.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to offer a simplified, high-contrast, and minimal-JavaScript interface for browsing Mastodon timelines, specifically designed for the unique display characteristics of e-ink readers like **Kindle**, **Kobo**, and similar devices. Reading long-form content or catching up on social feeds on e-ink is much easier on the eyes, and this frontend aims to make the Mastodon experience seamless on such devices.

## Features

*   **High Contrast:** Optimized styles for e-ink displays.
*   **Minimal JavaScript:** Reduces potential rendering issues and speeds up loading on less powerful devices.
*   **Simplified Layout:** Focuses on readability and easy navigation for e-paper screens.
*   **Open Source:** Feel free to contribute, report issues, or adapt the code!
